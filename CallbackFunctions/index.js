// 📞 Callback Function in JavaScript 
// A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later, usually after some operation has completed.


// In simple terms:
// A callback is a function you give to another function so it can “call you back” later.


// 🔹 Why Callbacks Are Important
// JavaScript is single-threaded and asynchronous. This means:
// It runs one task at a time.
// Some operations (like fetching data, reading files, timers) take time.
// Instead of blocking the program, JavaScript uses callbacks to handle results when they’re ready.
